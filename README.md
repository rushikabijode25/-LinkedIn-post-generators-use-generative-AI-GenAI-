# LinkedIn Post Generator using GenAI

This project is an AI-powered tool designed to help LinkedIn influencers generate new posts that match their unique writing style. By analyzing past LinkedIn posts, the system learns the user's tone, topics, language, and typical post length. It then uses this information to create future posts with a consistent voice and style.

## üß† What Does It Do?

Imagine Mohan, a LinkedIn influencer, wants to write a new post but is short on time or ideas. He can use this tool to:
1. Upload his previous LinkedIn posts.
2. Automatically extract the main topics, tone, language, and typical length of his posts.
3. Choose a topic, desired post length, and language.
4. Click "Generate" ‚Äî and get a brand-new LinkedIn post written in his own style.

5. ## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system has two major stages:

### Stage 1: Learning from Past Posts
- Takes Mohan's previous posts as input.
- Extracts key metadata: topic, language, post length, and writing style.

### Stage 2: Post Generation
- Mohan selects a topic, language, and length.
- A few relevant past posts are used as examples (few-shot learning).
- The tool uses a Generative AI model to generate a new post in Mohan's style.

## üí° Key Features
